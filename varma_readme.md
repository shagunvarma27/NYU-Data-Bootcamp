# data_bootcamp_final_project

This project was completed by Shagun Varma in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2019. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others - including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-phrasing thereof - has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:

Submitting the same of substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project description:

A theory by political scientists, known as the six-year itch, refers to the election during the incumbent President's sixth year in office wherein the party that holds the White House loses a significant number of House and Senate seats. This could be because a President in their second term does not need to worry about being reelected and therefore does not push for economic growth. This could create pessimism in the market that is reflected in stock prices. Through the lens of stock prices, I would like to study the impact of the six-year itch on market optimism.
